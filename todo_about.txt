0. functionally pretty much the same -> just new graphical design
	-default recipes: want to browse through them with tags (invisible tumblr tags) -> ingrediants, type, specialness

1. i'm working on a application that hooks up to her main website
	-like the online things where you make things:: intuitively create recipes of similar format
		-examples:: www.americangreetings.com creatable (look like me)
	-one set format?? multiple formats?? drag around? custom formats?
		-normal format (high contrast)
		-color-blind mode
		-scalable
		-landscape and portrait
			-export as xml, read by the "format reader"

	-make it so they can
		-save recipes to their account ->
		-make pdfs ->
		-submit it to anna's website/email for approval

		-allow them to cut out backgrounds of images they upload (like the elf myself)
	-exportable to a tablet/mobile pdf/website (swipe left and right, touch left and right to see an individual step)

	-built in tutorial
